    "### Additionally, answer the following questions in written form:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Did the file sizes increase or decrease when you used different formats and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the quality is at 1.0, there is (almost) no loss of quality. With the quality of 0.5, the loss is easily visible. With 0.0, the picture is a complete different one. As JPEG uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), it can reduce certain higher frequencies used for each block and therefore save space. The lower the quality, the more intense the quantisation of thew coefficients. More exact explanation in 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the difference between lossy and lossless image formats?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lossless image formats such as .BMP and .PNG only use lossless compression such as Huffman coding, arithmetic encoding, or run-length encoding. Mostly, the RGB values for every pixel are saved and restored, therefore reconstructing the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lossy formats, information in the image is lost irreversibly. Altough they use genious techniques to save space and the differences aren't that visible at high quality values, further processing and usage of the image becomes harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Explain the individual processing steps of the JPEG method following a complete process scheme as introduced in the course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The color space is changed to YCbCr, as luminance is more decisive for the human eye than the chrominance values.\n",
    "2. The chrominance values get downsampled (4 Pixel-blocks), as they make the least difference. (4:2:2 in Video)\n",
    "3. Pixels get divided into 8x8 blocks.\n",
    "4. Forward DCT is applied on the blocks. Each pixel in the block now stores certain frequencies in vertical or horizontal directions.\n",
    "5. Now, the most important step can be applied: quantization.\n",
    "    Here, the pixels (or entries in the matrix) with higher frequencies can be just set to zero, as they make the least difference for the human eye. The lower the quality value is set, the lower the threshhold for quantizing pixels.\n",
    "6. Entropy encoding: As there are a lot of \"0-pixels\" now in the matrix espacially in the high-frequency department, we use Run-Length-Encoding and Huffman Coding to save that space (in a zig-zag manner).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Considering your implementation of the `BlurImage` function, which paramaters can you add to extend the signature of your function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A repeat parameter could be added, which would tell the function to repeat the process a certain number of times.\n"
