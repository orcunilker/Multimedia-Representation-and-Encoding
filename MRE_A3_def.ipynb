    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use OpenCV and FFmpeg to implement very basic video editing functions. These tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a slide show (as a video) from images, and optionally create the slideshow as greyscale video.\n",
    "2. Extract the audio track from a video file.\n",
    "3. Replace the audio track in a video file.\n",
    "4. Combine two or more videos into one video file.\n",
    "5. Blend an image (fade-in/fade-out) with a video.\n",
    "6. Blend two videos into one video (video collage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following, you find the detailed specification of the assignment. For the assessment of your solution you are expected to demonstrate your implementation by playing back the produced video files and - for the purpose of profound understanding - to explain the output FFmpeg generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùó **Note:** To playback the produced videos in this assignment, please make use of the video-element of HTML5 to control the playback of a video so that the playback controls are available to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:** \n",
    "    Input: `./resources/video/sample1.mp4`.\n",
    "    Output: Video is played back \n",
    "    # the following function is to be provided by you\n",
    "    Function call: `VideoPlayer(\"./resources/video/sample1.mp4\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùó **Note:** General requirements for output Videos where applicable as follows:\n",
    "-\tOutput format: MP4\n",
    "-\tOutput Aspect Ratio: 1280*720\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùó **Note:** Please make sure that all potential errors, including handling files, paths, and run-time errors are handled properly (e.g., useful error messages to users).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùó **Note:** You must not use MoviePy in this assignment, as it causes some memory leaks and creates a lot of problems for you."
